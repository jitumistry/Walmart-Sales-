# Walmart Sales Prediction Project

This project focuses on forecasting weekly sales across Walmart stores using historical data and machine learning models. By analyzing sales trends, seasonal patterns, holidays, and economic indicators like CPI and unemployment, the model accurately predicts weekly sales to support inventory planning, staffing, and promotional strategies. Key techniques include data cleaning, feature engineering, time series analysis, and regression modeling (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, SARIMA). The project provides actionable insights into how holidays and store attributes influence sales fluctuations, improving business decision-making.

### Key Highlights:
- Comprehensive dataset integration of store, department, and economic features
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization to uncover sales trends and seasonality
- Modeling with machine learning and time series forecasting methods
- Evaluation using error metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R-squared
- Business impact through improved inventory management and promotional planning

The project demonstrates the power of data-driven forecasting in retail, turning historical data into precise future sales predictions.
